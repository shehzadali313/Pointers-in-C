The program handles three different data types: `int`, `float`, and `char`. It prints the addresses of these variables and the values stored at those addresses using pointers.
It shows how to: 
- Initialize a pointer to store the address of a variable.
- Access the exact value stored in a variable via its pointer.

## Key Concepts:
- Pointer declaration and initialization.
- Dereferencing pointers to access the value stored at the memory location.
- Proper usage of pointer types based on the variable type.

This example is helpful for beginners learning how pointers work in C programming.

### Compilation and Execution:
```bash
gcc pointers_example.c -o pointers_example
./pointers_example
